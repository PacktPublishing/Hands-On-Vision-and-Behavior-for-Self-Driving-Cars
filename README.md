**Explore visual perception, lane detection, and object classification with Python 3 and OpenCV 4**

## What is this book about?
This book will give you insights into the technologies that drive the autonomous car revolution. To get started, all you need is basic knowledge of computer vision and Python.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand how to perform camera calibration
* Become well-versed with how lane detection works in self-driving cars using OpenCV
* Explore behavioral cloning by self-driving in a video-game simulator
* Get to grips with using lidars
* Discover how to configure the controls for autonomous vehicles
* Use object detection and semantic segmentation to locate lanes, cars, and pedestrians
* Write a PID controller to control a self-driving car running in a simulator

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
img_threshold = np.zeros_like(channel)
img_threshold [(channel >= 180)] = 255
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for software engineers who are interested in learning about technologies that drive the autonomous car revolution. Although basic knowledge of computer vision and Python programming is required, prior knowledge of advanced deep learning and how to use sensors (lidar) is not needed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
### Software and Hardware List
